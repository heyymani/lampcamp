# LAMP Wilderness Project

This is set up for campers from the [LAMP Camp](http://lampcamp.guru/) who want a way to build upon the skills they have learned during the camp. 

Take this and use it how you want too. Build a CMS, a simple e-commerce package, or grab an api and build something around it. 

# Requirements

You need the following to work on a project:

* A text editor. You can use Notepad++, Sublime Text, PhpStorm, or even a Nitrous.io box.
* A server to serve up the PHP and MySQL. If you want simple and easy, [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/), [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/), [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). You will need to locate the HTDOCS file, and place the files in that folder in order for the server to find the files and serve them. Its that easy. If you want a challenge, look up [VirtualBox](virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](vagrantup.com) as a way to spin up a more robust and customizable server. I run a box from [Scotch.io](scotch.io). If you want to use that box, you will need to move your files into the "Public" folder. 
* Thats it! Have fun!
